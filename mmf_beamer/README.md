Beamer Template for the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics
==============================================

Welcome! This is the Beamer template for the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics. This style has been developed as part of the "Style Manual" project for the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of the Novosibirsk State University.

You can download this theme (together with the example presentation) [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/skqgmwfdkrph)


# Requirements

This theme requires `xcolor` and `tikz` packages. For this reason, you have to begin your document with:
```TeX
\documentclass[usenames,dvipsnames]{beamer}
```
This is **mandatory** due to compatibility issues between these two packages and `beamer`.

In order to use this theme for your Beamer presentation simply save your tex file into the directory, where you have the theme's files and (alongside aforementioned requirements)  write '\usetheme{MMF)'
# Acknowledgements

Î¤his theme is largely based on the Unofficial University of Udine beamer theme by Marco Basaldella, which you can find [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-udine-unofficial-beamer-theme/zndkgxrjsdzt). This theme was used as a skeleton for our project.

This theme contains items borrowed from Ratul Saha's Presento theme, available [here](https://github.com/RatulSaha/presento). In particular, `framecard` and `framepic` are based on the respective counterparts in Presento.

The development of this theme was made possible by the [TeX community at Stack Exchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/). There, we found lots of answers that saved us hours and headaches.
